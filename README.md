hello there, \n
i am a guy who made a script hub using an open source ui lib because why not, \n
i also kinda make shitty lua scripts, \n
feel free to fork off of the legendary-train repository, as it's now fully open source \n
floppamods is where i actually make my own scripts \n
floppamod-getmodule is where most of the multi-game scripts are stored to be used in a function \n
yea
