hello there, 
i am a guy who made a script hub using an open source ui lib because why not, 
i also kinda make shitty lua scripts, 
feel free to fork off of the legendary-train repository, as it's now fully open source, 
floppamods is where i actually make my own scripts, 
floppamod-getmodule is where most of the multi-game scripts are stored to be used in a function, 
yea
